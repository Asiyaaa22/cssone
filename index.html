    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <br/>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper,or in other media </li>
        <br/>
        <li><span>CSS is not necessary.</span><b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <br/>
        <li class="work">External style sheets are stored in CSS file.</li>
        <br/>

    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    
    <ul>
    
        <li style="letter-spacing: 5px;"> Inline - by using the attribute inside HTML elements1</li><br/>
        <li id="first">Internal - by using a style in  head section </li><br/>
        <li id="second"> External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li><br/>
        <li style="letter-spacing: 5px;">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However ,<b>in this<br/> tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for<br/> you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID , on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also<br/>special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an elements and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or arrange of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the<br/>element.</p>
    <p>There is wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
